        <h2>What Are Recovery Phrases?</h2>
        <p>A recovery phrase is a human-readable representation of your wallet's private key, typically consisting of 12 or 24 words. These words are selected from a standardized wordlist (usually BIP39) and must be kept secure and private.</p>

            <li><strong>12-word phrases</strong>: 128 bits of entropy, considered secure for most users</li>
            <li><strong>24-word phrases</strong>: 256 bits of entropy, offers higher security for high-value wallets</li>
